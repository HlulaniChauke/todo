This script creates a simple webpage with three tabs: Home, Menu, and Contact. Each tab corresponds to a different content section. When a tab is clicked, the script dynamically loads and displays the relevant content for that tab. The webpage structure includes a header with the tabs, a main content area, and a footer with a copyright notice. The functionality is implemented using JavaScript, and the content for each tab is generated by separate functions imported from external modules. The script also includes event listeners to respond to tab clicks and trigger the appropriate content generation function.
